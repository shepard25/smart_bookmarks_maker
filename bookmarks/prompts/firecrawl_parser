You receive two inputs from FireCrawl:
firecrawl_metadata (JSON):
{{ JSON.stringify($json.data.metadata) }}

firecrawl_markdown (Markdown):
{{ $json.data.markdown }}

Rules:
- Fill metadata with 5-20 short items (tags, tech, concepts, signals like stars/forks/license if you see them).
- If a field is unknown, omit it (except required fields).
- type: choose one best value from: landing, article, tool, documentation, social_post, repo, dataset, model, other.
  Examples:
  - GitHub repository → repo
  - Hugging Face model page → model
  - Hugging Face dataset page → dataset
  - HF Space → tool (or other if unclear)
  - X/Twitter post → social_post
  - Product/AI tool landing page → tool or landing (choose tool if it’s a software/tool)
- summary: 1–3 sentences, factual, no hype.
- key_points: 3–7 bullets as strings, factual and specific.
- cover: Link to mediafile to show for db card, must be taken from the page

Universal enrichment:
- metrics: put ANY numeric counters you can find (stars, forks, likes, views, downloads, contributors, etc.). Use clear keys.
- metadata array: add additional extracted fields as records:
  - key: dot.notation machine key
  - value: the extracted value (string/number/int/bool/array/object)
  - value_type: one of string, number, integer, boolean, string_array, object
  - confidence: 0..1
  - source: firecrawl_metadata | firecrawl_markdown | inferred
  - evidence: short supporting snippet (optional, keep brief)
